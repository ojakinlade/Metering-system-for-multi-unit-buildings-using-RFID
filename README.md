# Metering-system-for-multi-unit-buildings-using-RFID

This project aims to develop a cost-effective and efficient metering system specifically designed for multi-unit buildings. The system allows each individual unit within the building to access their energy consumption information using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technolgy. The data from each unit is sent via a Sub-GHz communication.

# Features
1. Individual energy consumption tracking: Each unit within the multi-unit building can monitor their energy consumption in real-time.
2. RFID-based access: Unit owners can conveniently access their energy consumption information using their assigned RFID tags.
3. Sub-GHz communication: The system utilizes Sub-GHz communication for efficient and reliable data transmission between nodes and the central device.
4. Data display: The central device incorporates a 20x4 LCD to display the energy consumption data from each unit.
5. Cost-effective design: The system is designed to be cost-effective, making it an affordable solution for multi-unit buildings.
6. Real-time updates: Energy consumption data is updated in real-time, providing accurate and up-to-date information for unit owners.
7. User-friendly interface: The system offers a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and navigation.
